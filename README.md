# RL-LAB

A minimal extensible learning framework built on OpenAI gymnasium and PyTorch

## Features
- Plug-and-play with any Gymnasium environment
- Modular design for any RL algorithm
- Ready-to-use baselines: `REINFORCE, DQN`
- Clean training loop with logging and evaluation

## Roadmap
- [x] Base framework with Gymnasium
- [ ] REINFORCE
- [ ] DQN
- [ ] PPO
- [ ] Tensorboard integration
- [ ] Weights and biases integration
